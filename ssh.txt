I want to access ubuntu system on windows with ssh. How and where can I create ssh public key?

ChatGPT said:
To access an Ubuntu system from Windows using SSH, you'll need to generate an SSH key pair (private + public) on your Windows machine, then copy the public key to your Ubuntu system. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Step 1: Generate SSH Key on Windows
If you're on Windows 10/11, use the built-in PowerShell or Windows Terminal:

Open PowerShell or Terminal as Administrator.

Run:


ssh-keygen
You'll see:


Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/YOUR_NAME/.ssh/id_rsa):
Just press Enter to accept the default path.

Optionally, enter a passphrase for extra security (or press Enter twice to skip).

This will generate:

Private key: C:\Users\<YourName>\.ssh\id_rsa

Public key: C:\Users\<YourName>\.ssh\id_rsa.pub

Step 2: Copy Public Key to Ubuntu
Use either of the following methods:

Option A: Using ssh-copy-id (if available)
If you have the ssh-copy-id tool (available via Git Bash or WSL), run:


ssh-copy-id user@ubuntu_ip
Option B: Manual Method
On Windows, open your .ssh folder:


notepad $HOME\.ssh\id_rsa.pub
Copy the full contents.

SSH into Ubuntu with a password:


ssh user@ubuntu_ip
On Ubuntu:

mkdir -p ~/.ssh
nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
Paste your public key into the file.

Save and exit (Ctrl+X, Y, Enter).

Set proper permissions:


chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
Step 3: Connect via SSH Without Password
Now from Windows, just run:


ssh user@ubuntu_ip
It should log you in without asking for a password.

PS C:\Windows\system32> ssh-keygen
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (C:\Users\k.k/.ssh/id_ed25519):
C:\Users\k.k/.ssh/id_ed25519 already exists.
Overwrite (y/n)? y
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in C:\Users\k.k/.ssh/id_ed25519
Your public key has been saved in C:\Users\k.k/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
The key fingerprint is:
