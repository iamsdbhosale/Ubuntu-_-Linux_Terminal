chmod u+x filename	Adds execute permission for the user (owner)
chmod g-w filename	Removes write permission from the group
chmod o+r filename	Adds read permission for others
chmod a+r filename	Adds read permission for all (user, group, others)

🔢 Numeric (Octal) Notation Examples

Explanation of 755:

7 (Owner): Read (4) + Write (2) + Execute (1) = 7
