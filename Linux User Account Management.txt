✅ 1. Allow sudo for Specific Users Only
Step 1: Make sure only trusted users are in the sudo group:
CMD :
getent group sudo
---
Step 2: To remove a user from sudo:
CMD :
sudo deluser username sudo

Ex.
sudo deluser laxmi sudo
sudo deluser tanmaybhosale sudo 
---
Step 3: To add a user to sudo:
CMD :
sudo usermod -aG sudo username
Ex.
sudo usermod -aG sudo tanmaybhosale
---
Restart SSH :
sudo systemctl restart ssh
---
🔧 1. Temporarily Change the Prompt
Just run this in your terminal:

CMD :
export PS1="[\u@\h \W]\$ "

Meaning of symbols:
Symbol	Meaning
\u	Username
\h	Hostname (short)
\W	Current directory (basename)
\w	Full path of current directory
\$	Shows $ for normal, # for root

To add a user in Linux with a home directory, use the following command:

sudo useradd -m username
Replace username with the actual name you want to give the user.

Explanation:
useradd – the command to create a new user.
-m – tells the system to create the user's home directory (e.g., /home/username).
---
set password too):
After adding the user, you can set their password with:

sudo passwd username
Ex. 
sudo passwd BHOSALE
---
To delete a user along with their home directory in Linux, use the following command:

sudo userdel -r username
Explanation:
userdel: Deletes the user account.
-r: Removes the user's home directory and mail spool along with the user account.
username: The name of the user you want to delete.
---
⚠️ Warning: This will permanently delete the user's home directory and all files inside it. Make sure to back up any important data before running this command.
---
If you only want to delete the home directory (not the user):
sudo rm -r /home/username
Use this only if the user account still exists but you want to remove their home directory manually.
---

Adding User in Linux:
useradd bhosale // adding user without home directory
useradd -m BHOSALE // adding user with home directory

sudo userdel -r BHOSALE
or for Root user :
userdel -r BHOSALE
---
pwd is knowing current path
---
sdbhosale@humanrobot:/home$ sudo su
[sudo] password for sdbhosale:
root@humanrobot:/home# useradd bhosale
root@humanrobot:/home# clear
root@humanrobot:/home# ls
laxmi  poojabhosale  sdbhosale  tanmaybhosale
root@humanrobot:/home# useradd -m bhosale
useradd: user 'bhosale' already exists
root@humanrobot:/home# useradd -m BHOSALE
root@humanrobot:/home# ls
BHOSALE  laxmi  poojabhosale  sdbhosale  tanmaybhosale
---
CMD to check Linux users  :
cat /etc/passwd
---
id username
above cmd used to know information of user

userdel: user bhosale is currently used by process 7617


ChatGPT said:
The error message:

userdel: user bhosale is currently used by process 7617
means you're trying to delete the user bhosale while a process belonging to that user (with PID 7617) is still running. Linux doesn't allow deletion of users who have active processes.

🛠️ Solution Options:
✅ Option 1: Kill the user’s processes before deleting

sudo pkill -u bhosale
sudo userdel -r bhosale
pkill -u bhosale kills all processes belonging to user bhosale.

userdel -r bhosale deletes the user and their home directory.

⚠️ Option 2: Kill only specific process
If you know what process 7617 is and want to just stop that:

sudo kill 7617
sudo userdel -r bhosale
🧪 Option 3: Force delete (not recommended)
You can try:

sudo userdel -f -r bhosale
⚠️ Use this only if you're sure the user's processes won't break anything (not logged in via SSH, not running critical services).

To add a group in Linux, you can use the groupadd command. Here's how:
sudo groupadd group_name
Ex.
sudo groupadd QA

To change group of existing user :
usermod -g QA laxmi

The useradd command in Linux is used to create a new user account on the system. It's a low-level command, and often used by system administrators to add users manually.

🔧 Syntax
useradd [options] USERNAME
⚙️ Common Options
Option	Description
-c	Comment (usually full name)
-d	Home directory
-e	Expiry date of the account (YYYY-MM-DD)
-f	Days after password expires until account is disabled
-g	Initial login group
-G	Additional groups (comma-separated)
-m	Create the home directory if it doesn't exist
-M	Do not create the home directory
-N	Do not create a group with the same name as the user
-p	Encrypted password
-s	Login shell
-u	User ID (UID)
-r	Create a system account (usually for daemons)

✅ Basic Examples
1. Add a user
sudo useradd john
Creates a user john without a home directory.

2. Add user with home directory
sudo useradd -m john
Creates /home/john and sets it as the home directory.

3. Add user with full name and default shell
sudo useradd -m -c "John Doe" -s /bin/bash john
Adds a user with a Bash shell and full name comment.

4. Add user with specific home directory
sudo useradd -m -d /custom/home/john john
Home directory will be /custom/home/john.

5. Add user with custom UID and GID
sudo useradd -u 1050 -g 100 john
UID: 1050, GID: 100 (you must ensure GID 100 exists).

6. Add user to additional groups
sudo useradd -m -G sudo,developers john
User will also be added to sudo and developers groups.

7. Add user with account expiry
sudo useradd -e 2025-12-31 john
Account will expire on Dec 31, 2025.

🔐 Setting Password
After creating a user, set a password:

sudo passwd john
🔍 Check User Info
getent passwd john
Or

id john
🗑️ Delete a User
sudo userdel john
Delete with home directory:


sudo userdel -r john
📁 Default Files Affected
/etc/passwd – User account information
/etc/shadow – Encrypted passwords and aging info
/etc/group – Groups info
/etc/default/useradd – Default settings for useradd
/etc/skel/ – Default files copied to new user's home
---


sudo useradd -m -c "Sachin Bhosale" -s /bin/bash humanRobot

humanRobot@humanrobot:~$ getent passwd humanRobot
humanRobot:x:1005:1007:Sachin Bhosale:/home/humanRobot:/bin/bash
humanRobot@humanrobot:~$ id humanRobot
uid=1005(humanRobot) gid=1007(humanRobot) groups=1007(humanRobot)

The number of users you can create on an Ubuntu (or any Linux) system is primarily limited by system constraints, not by a hardcoded number. Here's a breakdown:

🔢 Theoretical Limit
Each user on Linux is identified by a User ID (UID), which is an unsigned integer. The maximum number of users depends on the UID range.

▶ UID Range
UIDs are typically 32-bit integers.

So, maximum UID value is:


2^32 - 1 = 4,294,967,295
UID 0 is reserved for root, and some lower UIDs are reserved for system or service accounts.

➡ So in theory, you can have over 4 billion users.

⚠️ Practical Limit
In practice, these factors reduce the real number:

Factor	Explanation
/etc/passwd file performance	Every user entry is stored in /etc/passwd. With tens of thousands of users, it becomes slow to read or search.
Filesystem limits	Very large number of home directories might slow down the system (depends on filesystem like ext4 or XFS).
Login limitations	Having thousands of active users logged in at the same time is limited by CPU, RAM, and PAM/session limits.
UID limit settings	Ubuntu typically sets UID_MIN and UID_MAX in /etc/login.defs, like this:


UID_MIN 1000  
UID_MAX 60000
So by default, you can create about 59,000 normal users, unless you change this range.

🛠️ How to Check/Change UID Range
To check:


cat /etc/login.defs | grep UID
To change:
Edit /etc/login.defs and update:


UID_MIN 1000
UID_MAX 999999
Then you can create more users with useradd.

🧪 Summary
Type	Limit
Theoretical	~4.3 billion users
Default Ubuntu practical limit	~59,000 normal users (UID 1000–60000)
Adjustable?	✅ Yes, via /etc/login.defs
