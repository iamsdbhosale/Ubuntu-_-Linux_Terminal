To add a user in Linux with a home directory, use the following command:

sudo useradd -m username
Replace username with the actual name you want to give the user.

Explanation:
useradd – the command to create a new user.
-m – tells the system to create the user's home directory (e.g., /home/username).
---
set password too):
After adding the user, you can set their password with:

sudo passwd username
Ex. 
sudo passwd BHOSALE
---
To delete a user along with their home directory in Linux, use the following command:

sudo userdel -r username
Explanation:
userdel: Deletes the user account.
-r: Removes the user's home directory and mail spool along with the user account.
username: The name of the user you want to delete.
---
⚠️ Warning: This will permanently delete the user's home directory and all files inside it. Make sure to back up any important data before running this command.
---
If you only want to delete the home directory (not the user):
sudo rm -r /home/username
Use this only if the user account still exists but you want to remove their home directory manually.
---

Adding User in Linux:
useradd bhosale // adding user without home directory
useradd -m BHOSALE // adding user with home directory

sudo userdel -r BHOSALE
or for Root user :
userdel -r BHOSALE
---
pwd is knowing current path
---
sdbhosale@humanrobot:/home$ sudo su
[sudo] password for sdbhosale:
root@humanrobot:/home# useradd bhosale
root@humanrobot:/home# clear
root@humanrobot:/home# ls
laxmi  poojabhosale  sdbhosale  tanmaybhosale
root@humanrobot:/home# useradd -m bhosale
useradd: user 'bhosale' already exists
root@humanrobot:/home# useradd -m BHOSALE
root@humanrobot:/home# ls
BHOSALE  laxmi  poojabhosale  sdbhosale  tanmaybhosale

userdel: user bhosale is currently used by process 7617


ChatGPT said:
The error message:

userdel: user bhosale is currently used by process 7617
means you're trying to delete the user bhosale while a process belonging to that user (with PID 7617) is still running. Linux doesn't allow deletion of users who have active processes.

🛠️ Solution Options:
✅ Option 1: Kill the user’s processes before deleting

sudo pkill -u bhosale
sudo userdel -r bhosale
pkill -u bhosale kills all processes belonging to user bhosale.

userdel -r bhosale deletes the user and their home directory.

⚠️ Option 2: Kill only specific process
If you know what process 7617 is and want to just stop that:

sudo kill 7617
sudo userdel -r bhosale
🧪 Option 3: Force delete (not recommended)
You can try:

sudo userdel -f -r bhosale
⚠️ Use this only if you're sure the user's processes won't break anything (not logged in via SSH, not running critical services).
